# Hotel Booking and Cancellation

🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project on Hotel Booking and Cancellation Analysis! 📊🏨

Hey! 🌟

I just wrapped up a comprehensive project using Python and Jupyter Notebook, focusing on hotel booking and cancellation patterns. The journey has been incredibly insightful, and I'm thrilled to share some key findings and recommendations that can help hotels optimize their pricing strategies and reduce cancellations.

Here’s a sneak peek into what I discovered:

High Cancellation Rates: 37% of hotel bookings get canceled, significantly impacting revenue.
Booking Trends: City hotels tend to have more bookings compared to resort hotels, possibly due to affordability.
Seasonal Insights: August sees the highest bookings and cancellations, while January has the highest cancellation rate.
Price Impact: Higher prices correlate with higher cancellation rates, emphasizing the need for competitive pricing.
Booking Sources: 46% of bookings come from online travel agencies, highlighting their importance in the booking ecosystem.
Key Recommendations:

Implement dynamic pricing strategies to make hotel stays more appealing during off-peak seasons.
Strengthen relationships with online travel agencies to drive more bookings.
Target marketing campaigns in countries with high cancellation rates, like Portugal.
Enhance service quality, especially in resort hotels, and offer special packages on weekends and holidays.
🔍 Research Questions:

What variables affect hotel reservation cancellations?
How can we improve hotel reservation cancellations?
How can hotels make better pricing and promotional decisions?
📈 Data Visualization: The project includes detailed graphs and tables to support these insights.

I’m excited to present these findings to stakeholders and see how these strategies can make a real difference! Check out my detailed report for more insights.
